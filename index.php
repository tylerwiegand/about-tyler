		<h1>How Tyler Changed The World...</h1>
		<p>
			<t>At age five, Tyler had already completed the ten pre-requisites for induction into the hall of shame. By twelve
			he had managed to wrestle an alligator, and assist with the construction of the Hoover Dam (the second one).
			By twenty he had opened and closed ten major musical retailers, noting that the profit margins did not represent
			the stairway to heaven pictured.</p>
		<p>
			In his spare time, Tyler likes to ride magical rainbow unicorns through the dusty desert, play the
				drums, and make fun of short people. You can find him at the STEMulus Center 24/7 with his plush bear and
				sleeping bag, and his trusty laptop "Sally."
